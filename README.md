# Android-MVP-SQLite
This app was created to show on how to implement MVP in our Android Application. This implementation are base on Android Architecture Blueprints.
I will create another implementation of MVP in the future. 

## Why use MVP?

MVP makes views independent from our data source. We divide the application into at least three different layers, which let us test them independently. With MVP we are able to take most of logic out from the activities so that we can test it without using instrumentation tests.

## Reference

This sample app inspired by [Android Architecture Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).
